# academic-cv

I took [these](https://grad.illinois.edu/careers/cv) tips as an example and created a Jekyll theme based on them so that anyone can publish their academic CV on GitHub pages for free. Checkout the live demo [here](https://bulhakovolexii.github.io/academic-cv/).

## Installation
 - [Fork](https://github.com/bulhakovolexii/academic-cv/fork) the repository;
 - Go to settings and set `main` branch as Github Pages source;
 - Your new site should be ready at `https://<username>.github.io/academic-cv/`;

 Change all the details from one place: `_data/data.yml`.

 ## License

 The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/bulhakovolexii/academic-cv/blob/main/LICENSE).

 I spotted the idea in the project [online-cv](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) (published by @sharu725 and under the MIT license).
